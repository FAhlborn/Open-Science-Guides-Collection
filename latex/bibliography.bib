abstract = {Open science initiatives, which are often collaborative efforts focused on making research more transparent, have experienced increasing popularity in the past decade. Open science principles of openness {and} transparency provide opportunities to advance diversity, justice, {and} sustainability by promoting diverse, just, {and} sustainable outcomes among both undergraduate {and} senior researchers. We review models that demonstrate the importance of greater diversity, justice, {and} sustainability in psychological science before describing how open science initiatives promote these values. Open science initiatives also promote diversity, justice, {and} sustainability through increased levels of inclusion {and} access, equitable distribution of opportunities {and} dissemination of knowledge, {and} increased sustainability stemming from increased generalizability. In order to provide an application of the concepts discussed, we offer a set of diversity, justice, {and} sustainability lens questions for individuals to use while assessing research projects {and} other organizational systems {and} consider concrete classroom applications for these initiatives.},
