To help them meet these expectations {and} generally manage {and} share their data more effectively, we are developing a suite of tools which we are currently referring to as "Support Your Data". These tools, which include a rubric designed to enable researchers to self-assess their current data management practices {and} a series of short guides which provide actionable information about how to advance practices as necessary or desired, are intended to be easily customizable to meet the needs of a researchers working in a variety of institutional {and} disciplinary contexts.},

Although presented in text form, scientific knowledge is normally based on the analysis of research data. Open access (OA) to data means making these data available to users {and} other researchers for (re-)use with as few restrictions as possible.
